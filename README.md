# Semester-4-Database Systems-Project

[ Prerequisite(s) ]

You need to have Oracle 11g Installed for it to work.
In Oracle 11g you need to have an account with Username: Dani, Password: 123
// string str = "Data Source=localhost:1521/XE;User Id=dani;Password=123;";
// Form1.cs : Line-79

In that account you need to run the files as following:
'remove_tables.txt' Run contents of this file as an SQL Command.
Load Tables using `tables.sql`

One that is done you need to open 'insert into' folder and run each sql through sql loader.

Once that is done you are ready to run the program!

(( Check "USER_TABLE" for username & password combinations. ))
